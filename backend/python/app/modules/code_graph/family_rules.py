"""What a language family's names can mean, as rules the edge builder reads.

The builder used to branch on family names at each decision (`family == "js"`,
`family in {"jvm", "csharp"}`). Those decisions live here as one table, so a
language is added by adding its row, and its hooks, not by editing the builder.
Every row reproduces the builder's behaviour from before the table existed.
