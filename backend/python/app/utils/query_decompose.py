            QUERY TO ANALYZE: {query}

            **YOUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS:**

            1. **ANALYZE THE QUERY:**
               - Assess complexity (simple factual vs multi-faceted)
               - Identify scope (narrow vs broad topic coverage needed)
               - Determine information depth required
               - Consider potential ambiguities or missing context

            2. **CHOOSE THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY:**

            **DECOMPOSE_AND_EXPAND** - Use when:
            - Query has multiple complex components that need individual attention
            - Query asks about relationships between different concepts
            - Query would benefit from both breaking down AND additional context
            - Query is compound (contains "and", "but", multiple questions, etc.)
            - Example: "How do climate policies affect economic growth and what strategies balance environment with development?"

            **EXPANSION** - Use when:
            - Query is focused but would benefit from broader context
            - Query is about a concept that has related important aspects
            - Query could be enhanced with background, comparisons, or implications
            - Query is clear but somewhat narrow in scope
            - Example: "What is quantum computing?" → expand to include types, applications, challenges, etc.

            **NONE** - Use when:
            - Query is already well-structured and complete
            - Query is very specific and doesn't need additional context
            - Query is procedural or instructional
            - Adding more queries would create noise rather than value
            - Example: "What is the capital of France?"

            3. **GENERATE QUERIES STRATEGICALLY:**

            For **DECOMPOSE_AND_EXPAND**:
            - Create 2-4 core decomposition queries (Very High/High confidence)
            - Add 2-4 expansion queries for context (Medium/High confidence)
            - Ensure decomposition queries cover all aspects of original query
            - Ensure expansion queries add valuable related information

            For **EXPANSION**:
            - Include the original query (Very High confidence)
            - Add 3-5 related queries (High/Medium confidence)
            - Cover: background, types/categories, applications, comparisons, implications, challenges

            For **NONE**:
            - Return only the original query (Very High confidence)

            4. **CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES:**
            - **Very High**: Essential for answering the original query
            - **High**: Important for comprehensive understanding
            - **Medium**: Valuable context but not critical
            - **Low**: Potentially relevant but uncertain value

            **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
            Provide your analysis and decision as a JSON object:

            {{
                "queries": [
                    {{"query": "query text", "confidence": "confidence level"}},
                    // ... more queries

                "reason": "Detailed explanation of your analysis and why you chose this strategy. Explain what makes this query complex/simple, what information gaps you identified, and how your chosen queries address the user's information needs.",
                "operation": "decompose_and_expand|expansion|none"
            }}

            **EXAMPLES:**

            Complex Query → DECOMPOSE_AND_EXPAND:
            Input: "How do social media algorithms affect democracy and what can be done to mitigate negative impacts while preserving free speech?"
            Analysis: This is a complex, multi-faceted query with two main components (effects on democracy + solutions) plus a constraint (preserving free speech). It needs decomposition to address each aspect thoroughly, plus expansion for crucial context.
            Output:
            {{
                "queries": [
                    {{"query": "How do social media algorithms influence democratic processes and voter behavior?", "confidence": "Very High"}},
                    {{"query": "What are the documented negative impacts of social media on democratic institutions?", "confidence": "Very High"}},
                    {{"query": "What regulatory and technical solutions exist for addressing algorithmic bias in social media?", "confidence": "High"}},
                    {{"query": "How can content moderation balance harm prevention with free speech principles?", "confidence": "High"}},
                    {{"query": "What are successful examples of social media regulation in different countries?", "confidence": "Medium"}},
                    {{"query": "How do different social media platforms' algorithms compare in terms of democratic impact?", "confidence": "Medium"}}
                ],
                "reason": "This query requires decompose_and_expand because it contains multiple complex components: algorithmic effects on democracy, solution identification, and free speech considerations. Decomposition separates these core aspects, while expansion adds crucial context about regulation examples and platform comparisons.",
                "operation": "decompose_and_expand"
            }}

            Simple Query → EXPANSION:
            Input: "What is blockchain technology?"
            Analysis: This is a straightforward definitional query, but blockchain is a complex technology that benefits from contextual understanding including applications, types, and challenges.

            Output:
            {{
                "queries": [
                    {{"query": "What is blockchain technology?", "confidence": "Very High"}},
                    {{"query": "What are the main types of blockchain networks?", "confidence": "High"}},
                    {{"query": "How does blockchain differ from traditional databases?", "confidence": "High"}},

                    {{"query": "What are the current limitations and challenges of blockchain technology?", "confidence": "Medium"}},
                    {{"query": "How does blockchain ensure security and immutability?", "confidence": "Medium"}}
                ],
                "reason": "This query benefits from expansion because while the core question is simple, blockchain is a foundational technology that requires understanding of its types, applications, and limitations for comprehensive knowledge.",
                "operation": "expansion"
            }}
