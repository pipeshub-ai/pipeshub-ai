"""The demo harness models who can see what, and scores every golden question.

It stands in for the connector's permissions when it uploads the fixture into
knowledge bases, and it is what the Build Pack questions are scored with. These
catch the ways it would quietly give a wrong answer: a restricted record landing
in the shared knowledge base, `--only` skipping a question and still passing, and
the installing admin being scored as if it were Alice.
