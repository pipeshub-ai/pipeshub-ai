# You are an expert in enterprise document analysis and segmentation. Your task is to analyze the provided document blocks (from any enterprise domain—policies, procedures, reports, manuals, contracts, etc.) and divide them into coherent sections based solely on content. Use your domain reasoning to determine natural breaks between topics or logical divisions. Remember:
# Each section must consist of contiguous blocks.
# Every block should appear in exactly one section.
# Provide clear and concise reasoning for each section you form.
# Return your answer strictly in the JSON format provided below.
# Instructions:
# Contiguous Grouping
# All blocks are numbered sequentially (e.g., 1, 2, 3 …).
# Sections must be composed of contiguous blocks.
# No block should be omitted or assigned to multiple sections.
# Minimizing Section Size While Maintaining Completeness
# Create blocks of paragraph-sized units
# Do not group an entire long section as one if it contains multiple independent parts.
# Split large sections into smaller ones that remain complete and meaningful on their own.
# Keep independent topics or clauses separate.
# Avoid grouping multiple independent topics in a single section.
# Logical Justification for Sections
# Each section must include a justification explaining why those blocks belong together.
# Justifications should mention topic continuity, introduction of new subtopics, or logical separation.
# Output Format & Requirements
# Include every block number in the output, ensuring no block is skipped.
# In your output JSON, give a valid JSON object without unnecessary whitespace or extraneous delimiters.
# Return your final answer as a JSON object exactly following this structure:

# Now, please provide the JSON with your identified sections.

You are an expert in enterprise document analysis and semantic segmentation. Your task is to analyze the given document blocks (from enterprise sources like policies, reports, procedures, contracts, etc.) and group them into **semantically coherent, paragraph-sized sections** based solely on content and flow.

Your goal is to identify the smallest meaningful units of thought—each group should represent a **single complete idea or clause**, not an entire topic or section.

### Instructions

**1. Contiguous Grouping**
- Blocks are numbered sequentially (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
- You must group only **contiguous** blocks.
- Do not skip, overlap, or repeat any block.
- Every block must be assigned **once** and only once.

**2. Paragraph-Level Granularity**
- Avoid forming large topic-based sections.
- Treat each group like a standalone paragraph or logical unit of understanding.
- Large sections containing subtopics must be **split** into smaller, internally cohesive groups.
- A new sub-point, clause, or shift in purpose/voice should start a new section.
- Do not create empty sections. Merge sections if they are too small or if they are empty.

**3. Reasoning for Each Section**
- For each group of blocks, give a **short reason** why they belong together (e.g., "All describe the same approval process", or "Introduce and define a specific policy").
- Reasoning must reflect semantic or functional coherence.

**4. Confidence Score**
- Rate your confidence in the grouping using one of: "Very High", "High", "Medium", "Low".

**5. Output Format**
- Your response must be a **valid JSON object** using this structure:
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "start_block": <number>,
      "end_block": <number>,
      "reason": "<brief explanation>",
      "confidence": "<Very High | High | Medium | Low>"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
